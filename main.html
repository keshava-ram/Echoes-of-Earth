                <p>Wildlife preservency refers to the conservation and protection of wild animals, plants, and their natural habitats to maintain ecological balance and biodiversity. As human activities increasingly encroach on forests, wetlands, and grasslands, wildlife faces severe threats including habitat loss, pollution, poaching, and climate change. Preserving wildlife is essential not only for the survival of species but also for the health of ecosystems that support human life.

                Efforts in wildlife preservency include the creation of national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, and biosphere reserves where human interference is limited or regulated. Organizations and governments also run breeding programs, anti-poaching patrols, and awareness campaigns to protect endangered species.</p>

                    Modern wildlife preservation also involves scientific research, satellite monitoring, and collaboration with local communities to ensure sustainable coexistence. Laws like the Wildlife Protection Act (India) and global agreements like CITES help regulate wildlife trade and enforce conservation policies.
                    Wildlife preservency is not just about saving animals; it's about preserving Earth’s natural heritage for future generations. Every species plays a role in the ecosystem, and protecting them ensures a healthier planet. Public support, education, and responsible practices can greatly contribute to successful conservation efforts.
